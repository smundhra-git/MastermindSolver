This code is an implementation of the Mastermind game. The game consists of a codebreaker trying to guess the code created by the codemaker. The code is made up of 4 pegs of different colors (B, R, G, Y, P).

The evaluateGuess function takes two strings as input, the code and the guess, and returns a pair of integers representing the number of black and white pegs. A black peg means that the peg is the correct color and in the correct position. A white peg means that the peg is the correct color but in the wrong position.

The user function takes in a previous code, the number of black pegs, and the number of white pegs as input. It returns the next guess of the codebreaker.

The generateCode function generates a random code for the codemaker.

The checkCode function takes in an entered code and the actual code, and updates the number of black and white pegs as output.

The program also includes several other libraries such as <algorithm>, <iostream>, <set>, <string>, <utility>, and <vector>. These libraries are used for various tasks such as input/output, random number generation, and manipulating strings and vectors.
